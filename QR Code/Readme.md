## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- 

### What I learned

- **HTML Clarity**: I honed my ability to structure HTML in a way that's clear and accessible, making it easier for users and developers alike to understand.

- **CSS Aesthetics**: I experimented with CSS to create visually appealing designs that complemented the functionality of the QR code component, using colors and layouts effectively.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web) - Comprehensive documentation for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This is my go-to resource for learning about web technologies and understanding their usage.
- [W3Schools CSS Reference](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/) - A comprehensive reference guide for CSS properties, selectors, syntax, and examples. It's a valuable resource for quickly looking up CSS concepts and understanding their usage in web development.
