## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- **Responsiveness**: I applied responsive design principles to make the blog preview card work well on both mobile and desktop devices.
- **CSS Flexbox**: I used Flexbox to create clean and flexible layouts, improving my understanding of this layout module.

### Continued development

In future projects, I plan to:

- Enhance the accessibility of my components
- Continue improving my CSS Grid and Flexbox skills
- Experiment with animations and transitions for more interactive designs
- Focus on responsive design techniques to ensure a seamless experience across devices
- Integrate interactive elements for a more engaging user experience
- Maintain good documentation practices for better project clarity and collaboration

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web) - Comprehensive HTML, CSS, and JavaScript documentation. This is my go-to resource for learning about web technologies and understanding their usage.
- [W3Schools CSS Reference](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/) - A comprehensive reference guide for CSS properties, selectors, syntax, and examples. It's a valuable resource for quickly looking up CSS concepts and understanding their usage in web development.
